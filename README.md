# Simon-Says-Game

## Description
The **Simon Says Game** is a memory-based game where the user needs to follow a sequence of colors generated by the game. The sequence increases in length with each correct input. The player needs to repeat the sequence by clicking the colors in the order shown by the game.

This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features dynamic updates, animations, and a high-score tracker.

## Game Instructions
1. **Start the Game**: Press the "Start Game" button to begin.
2. The game will blink a color.
3. Click the color that was blinked.
4. The game will blink another color.
5. Click the colors in the correct sequence, starting from the beginning.
6. Continue following the sequence, with each new level adding one more color to the sequence.

If you make a mistake, the game will notify you and reset. The goal is to get the highest possible score by memorizing and repeating the longest sequence of colors.

## Features
- **Start the Game**: Press the "Start Game" button to begin the game.
- **Level Progression**: As you correctly follow the color sequence, the game progresses to the next level with a longer sequence.
- **High Score Tracking**: The highest score is saved using `localStorage` and displayed on the game screen.

- **Reset High Score**: Reset the high score with a separate button.
